# Expense_tracker_app
An expense tracker app built using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript would be a web-based application accessible through a web browser. It would likely have the following basic features:

A dashboard that displays a summary of the user's expenses, income, and budget.

A chart or graph that visualizes the user's spending habits over time.

The app would be designed using HTML for the structure and content, Bootstrap for the layout and styling, and JavaScript for the interactivity and functionality. It would likely use a backend database to store user data and allow for data persistence.
